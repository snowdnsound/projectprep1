## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

* Everyone gets to say their piece, no “but’s” without “why’s”

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* Code Word Spirit Stick. This is a word we can say when we feel like someone is taking over the conversation and we would like to give our input.
