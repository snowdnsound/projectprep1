## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.  

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?  

* AP- Javascript - constructors, formating code, semantics, objects, dom manipulation, loops
* JB- CSS, HTML, Project Management, Photoshop, Illustrator (learn more JS)

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

* Wire Framing Initial Design
* Paired Programming
* Creating very clean visuals and an interactive web page
* Feature planning and implementation

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strengths

* AP- It would be cool to develop a greater sense of creative competency, as well as technical competency in regards to pushing myself in js/css
* JB- Learn more JS, team collaboration 
* GD- I’d love to develop my skills with JS further, and increase my understanding of technical terminology to articulate ideas better.
* DS- would love to learn more about JavaScript +Dom Manipulation

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

* The team will touch base before each session in a stand up
* Code review at the end of each day

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

* Everyone gets to say their piece, no “but’s” without “why’s”

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* Code Word Spirit Stick. This is a word we can say when we feel like someone is taking over the conversation and we would like to give our input.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* Using paired programming to stop and talk about concepts that some may not understand what is happening.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

* We will ask Titus to intervene.

### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

* Bring in other code fellows if we start to fall behind on our daily tasks.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

* We will just slack our code fellows and they can answer at their earliest convenience.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

* Spirit stick code word, any input is wrote down.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

* Practicing Boundaries
* Agreeing to spirit Stick
* Trying to follow communication hours
* End each code review with a closing thoughts to make sure we are on the same page.
* Start each day discussing a “Weekday Win”

## Work Plan

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 

* This will be discussed in our Stand Up/Start Up meeting
* We will use the github project board to identify and know when tasks are complete.

* Github Project Boards
* VS Code Live
* Slack

* How many people must review a PR? 2 Times
* Who merges PRs? Drew “The Merge-Man” Stroede
* How often will you merge? Only merging to the main branch when features are complete.
